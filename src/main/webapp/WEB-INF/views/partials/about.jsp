	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
		The Bookish platform is a free, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">open source</a>,
		distributed book content management and reading platform.<br>
		We share the ideology expressed by the Open Access movement.<br>
	</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
		Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves.
		The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, 
		is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations.
		</p>
		[...]
		<p>
		sharing isn't immoral - it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.
		</p>
