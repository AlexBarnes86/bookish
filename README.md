Bookish
=======

Book management and content platform

This application is currently undergoing initial development and is therefore highly unstable and experimental.

* Makes use of Spring, Spring-Data, and neo4j
* Use mvn eclipse:eclipse to generate an eclipse project
* Create a local eclipse tomcat server instance to deploy to (optional)

Installation: create /var/www/bookish/graphdb and give your server access permissions to read and modify. Alternatively, edit the spring configuration to point to a different location. Eventually these configurations will make their way into a more friendly place.
